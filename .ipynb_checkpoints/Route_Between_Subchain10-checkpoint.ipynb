      "* **Denied Training:** However, Dronacharya refused to teach Eklavya because he was not a Kshatriya (warrior class). This was due to Dronacharya's prejudice and his commitment to teaching only the princes of the Kuru kingdom.\n",
      "* **Self-Taught Mastery:** Undeterred, Eklavya carved a clay image of Dronacharya and practiced relentlessly, treating it as his teacher. He achieved extraordinary skill, surpassing even the Kuru princes in archery.\n",
      "* **The Thumb Sacrifice:** When Dronacharya discovered Eklavya's prowess, he demanded a \"guru dakshina\" (teacher's fee). Eklavya, in his unwavering devotion, offered his right thumb, the most crucial part of an archer's hand.\n",
      "* **A Symbol of Dedication:** Eklavya's story is a powerful parable about dedication, perseverance, and the injustice of social prejudice. His sacrifice is a testament to his unwavering commitment to his craft and his willingness to pay any price for his passion.\n",

Anything that crosses this boundary is trapped forever.\\n* **No escape:**  The gravity of the black hole is so powerful that even light, the fastest thing in the universe, cannot escape its pull.\\n\\nThink of it like this: Imagine a bowling ball placed on a trampoline. It creates a dip in the trampoline. Now, imagine a much heavier object like a cannonball. It would create a much deeper dip.  A black hole is like that cannonball, creating a \"dip\" in spacetime so deep that nothing can climb back out. \\n\\nThere are many different types of black holes, from tiny ones called stellar black holes to supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies.

Key Players:**\\n\\n* **Angles:**  We measure angles in degrees or radians.\\n* **Sides:**  We deal with the lengths of the sides of right triangles (triangles with one 90-degree angle).\\n\\n**3. The Special Functions:**\\n\\n* **Sine (sin), Cosine (cos), Tangent (tan):**  These are the main trigonometric functions. They tell us ratios between the sides of a right triangle based on its angles. \\n    * **Sine (sin):**  Opposite side / Hypotenuse\\n    * **Cosine (cos):**  Adjacent side / Hypotenuse\\n    * **Tangent (tan):**  Opposite side / Adjacent side\\n\\n**4. Beyond Triangles:**\\n\\n* **Applications:** Trigonometry is used in many fields, including:\\n    * **Navigation:**  Determining distances and directions\\n    * **Engineering:**  Designing structures and machines\\n    * **Physics:**  Understanding waves and oscillations\\n    * **Astronomy:**  Calculating distances in space\\n\\n**5.
